# ETL Pipeline of Cola Next Pvt. Ltd. using Apache Airflow

## Overview:
Data warehouses are hallmarks of industrial data analytics initiatives. Trends of developing analytical pipelines without data warehouses may be non-sustainable and non-scalable. At the same time, structuring a structured warehouse or data mart from a non-clean, haphazard, highly normalized, and adhoc OLTP “spaghetti” is a big challenge. In this challenge, you will be required to structure a data warehouse (henceforth data mart) from a given OLTP spaghetti, and transfer data from OLTP to the data mart. The requirement is to implement the mart as a star schema through dimensional modelling. 

## Problem Statement
Next Cola, a beverages company, struggles to maintain optimal inventory levels across its expanding network of warehouses. Inefficient stock management leads to frequent stockouts, overstocking, and lost revenue. Next Cola aims to implement a data warehouse solution specifically tailored for inventory analysis to empower data-driven decision-making.
